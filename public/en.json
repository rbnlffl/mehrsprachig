Under the name \"Coleus canina\", is sold and marketed as a natural repellent to cats and dogs (labeled as \"Scaredy Cat Plant\" and \"Piss-off plant\"), though no research currently exists that supports that usage. These plants root easily from cuttings or from just touching the ground. They like full sun.",
